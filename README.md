## Code Structures
To reproduce our experiments with FEAT, please use **train_fsl.py**. There are four parts in the code.
 - `model`: It contains the main files of the code, including the few-shot learning trainer, the dataloader, the network architectures, and baseline and comparison models.
 - `data`: Images and splits for the data sets.
 - `saves`: The pre-trained weights of different networks.
 - `checkpoints`: To save the trained models.

## Hyper-Parameters

**For Task and Data**
- `dataset`: Option for the dataset (`MiniImageNet`, `TieredImageNet`, or `CUB`), default to `MiniImageNet`

- `way`: The number of classes in a few-shot task during meta-training, default to `5`

- `eval_way`: The number of classes in a few-shot task during meta-test, default to `5`

- `shot`: Number of instances in each class in a few-shot task during meta-training, default to `1`

- `eval_shot`: Number of instances in each class in a few-shot task during meta-test, default to `1`

- `query`: Number of instances in each class to evaluate the performance during meta-training, default to `15`

- `eval_query`: Number of instances in each class to evaluate the performance during meta-test, default to `15`

**For FEAT**
- `use_euclidean`: Use the euclidean distance or the cosine similarity to compute pairwise distances. We use the euclidean distance in the paper. Default to `False`

- `backbone_class`: Types of the encoder, i.e., the convolution network (`ConvNet`), ResNet-12 (`Res12`), or Wide ResNet (`WRN`), default to `ConvNet`

- `balance`: This is the balance weight for the contrastive regularizer. Default to `0`

- `temperature`: Temperature over the logits, we #divide# logits with this value. It is useful when meta-learning with pre-trained weights. Default to `1`

- `temperature2`: Temperature over the logits in the regularizer, we divide logits with this value. This is specially designed for the contrastive regularizer. Default to `1`

**For PRW**

- `is_ssl`: Use PRW loss or not, as well as Semi-supervised or Supervised. Default to `1`
- `tau`:  
- `tempreture_ssl`:
- `alpha`:
- `lamda`: the weight of the loss. Default to `1`
